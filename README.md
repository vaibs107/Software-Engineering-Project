# Software-Engineering-Project
High School Book Tracking Application:
* The High School Book Tracking system basically upgrades the manual library system into an internet-based application so that the users can know the details of their accounts, availability of books, maximum borrowing capacity etc.
* The overall goal of this project is to develop a Web-based application from scratch - from requirements gathering to implementation and deployment - for bookkeeping in a high school library. It is used for controlling and monitoring transactions in the library using the Software Engineering Principles. 
* This project is developed in Java and mainly focuses on basic operations in library like adding new members (students and teachers), adding new books, searching for books and facilitate students and teachers to access the library books and use them on a rental basis for a specified amount of time.
* It also does a reporting job for producing the following reports.
	1. List of all the students with books checked out showing due date and date
	checked out
	2. List of all authorized users and their access level
	3. List of all books in the system with search capabilities
	4. List of all books checked out by class or book name/number
	5. List of students and parents’ info with amount due
	This report generation functionality of the system helps to get a good idea of which books are borrowed by the members and makes users generate the reports' hard copy.
